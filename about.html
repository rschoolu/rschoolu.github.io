    <a>Programming is my hobby. I do it for fun, when I don't feel like programming, I don't. I have a friend, their channel can be found </a>
    <a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMhND2dCg0AtW5egCXqK_Gw">here.</a><br>
    <a>I like to make videos on my youtube channel too, that can be found </a><a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7lF0GsddgccP82cfH--KPg">here.</a><br>
    <a>Most of the videos on my youtube channel are stupid and random, but I do like to play Geometry Dash!</a><br>
    <a>I love creating Geometry Dash levels, but motivation loss has gotten in the way of that.</a><br>
    <a>My Geometry Dash Username Can Be: chriscolumbusgd, rschoolu</a><br>
    <a>Why chriscolumbusgd? I did a dare.</a><br>
    <a>I hope you found this about page helpful, or something.</a>
