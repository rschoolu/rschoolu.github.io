    <ul>
        <li>Screen Monitoring<br>
                I never got this one. It just feels like someone looming over your shoulder at all times, except when you turn to look, they're not there.
        </li>
        <li>Tab Closing<br>
                I hate this one too, it's like you wanna email someone, right? and then your teacher goes, "YoU'rE nOt SuPpOsEd To Be On ThAt!!!!!", but it's actually really important.
        </li>
        <li>Website Blocking<br>
                Why does everything have to be blocked? Like seriously, you spend more time blocking sh*t than actually doing your job. It feels like they don't want you to have fun, on top of that you have the sh*t chromebooks.
        </li>
        <li>Disable Browsing<br>
                This is spyware sh*t now, like seriously you don't need full access and control to the chromebook.
        </li>
    </ul>
